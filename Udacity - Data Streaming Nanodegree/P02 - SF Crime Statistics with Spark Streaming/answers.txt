Q1 :
How did changing values on the SparkSession property parameters 
affect the throughput and latency of the data?
cganging these values increased  ( processedRowsPerSecond ) from 4 to almost 32.




Q 2 :
What were the 2-3 most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs? 
Through testing multiple variations on values, 
how can you tell these were the most optimal?


most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs I used :
"maxOffsetsPerTrigger", 1000
"spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition", 300
"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 200

why :
they gave me the best performance when it comes to data rate processing
